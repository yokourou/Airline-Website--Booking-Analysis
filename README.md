## Objective

The goals of this project are as follows:

1. **Collect Data:** Gather relevant data from the website, including product prices, sales volume, and customer behavior.

2. **Analyze Trends:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and identify patterns, seasonality, and trends.

3. **Generate Insights:** Use Power BI to visualize insights derived from the analysis, providing a clear understanding of the relationships between pricing and various factors.

4. **Optimize Pricing:** Implement dynamic pricing strategies based on the insights gained, adjusting prices according to seasonal trends, market demand, and other influencing factors.
